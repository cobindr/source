cobindR - Transcription Factor co-binding analysis for R 
=======

cobindR detects pairs of transcription factor binding sites. Its focus is 
ease of use, rigorous statistical testing, and good visualization.

Background
--

Transcription factors (TFs) can regulate gene expression by binding to 
specific DNA motifs near genes. Moreover, gene expression can be controlled 
by combinations of TFs, which either cooperate or interfere with each other. 
High thoughput methods, like ChIP-Seq, are available to indicate large numbers 
of potential regulatory regions. In silico analysis of trancription factor 
binding sites (TFBS) helps to interprete datasets or to narrow down the 
results for further experimental studies.
